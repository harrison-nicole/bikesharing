## Overview of the Bikesharing Analysis Project
The Bikesharing Analysis project was created to assess bikesharing data from NYC in order to understand trends and opportunities for a bikesharing program in Des Moines. The goal was to utilize data from the NYC bikesharing program to develop a business proposal for the program in Des Moines. The analysis focused on key components such as gender, peak hours, start and stop times, duration, and user type.


## Results

This pie chart demonstrates the percentage of total rides by gender. Overall, we can see that males comprise approximately 2/3 of all rides and may help inform marketing strategies targeting male audiences.

This bar chart shows that bikes are most frequently utilized during the hours of 5 and 6pm. We also see higher volumes of rides in the 8 am hour. This information will help inform repair schedules. It's reassuring to see that high volume ride times coincide with the most popular commute times in Des Moines as this suggests we may see similar trends.

Looking more closely at trends in when bikes are most commonly used, this heatmap shows us that the commute times (8am and 4-5pm) are also most common Monday-Friday. It also shows higher ride volumes on Saturdays.

This chart provides a more focused view of trip duration by adding in the gender filter. We can see that regardless of gender, a majority of trips are 40 minutes or less in duration.


## Summary 
In summary, the information gathered from the NYC bikesharing program supports the business plan for the program in Des Moines. The data demonstrates peak volumes during the typical commute times (8am-9am and 5-7pm) as well as high volumes on Saturdays. These times align well with high volume traffic times in Des Moines. Additionally, the program is well utilized by both males and females. We also learned optimal times for bike repairs based on utilization trends. To further inform the Des Moines business proposal, it may be helpful to create visualizations to show utilization by age and socio-economic status. There are many colleges in Des Moines, so it could also be helpful to understand how to market to that audience.
